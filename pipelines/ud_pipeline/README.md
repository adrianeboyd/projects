# ü™ê spaCy Project: Train a pipeline from a UD corpus

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project template uses the new [**spaCy v3.0**](https://nightly.spacy.io), which
> is currently available as a nightly pre-release. You can install it from pip as `spacy-nightly`:
> `pip install spacy-nightly`. Make sure to use a fresh virtual environment.

The project shows how to train a pipeline with a tagger, morphologizer and parser from a UD corpus. The pipeline is evaluated using the CoNLL 2018 shared task evaluation script.

## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://nightly.spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://nightly.spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `preprocess` | Convert the data to spaCy's binary format |
| `train` | Train a tagger, a morphologizer and a parser |
| `evaluate` | Evaluate the model and export metrics |
| `package` | Package the trained model so it can be installed |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://nightly.spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | `preprocess` &rarr; `train` &rarr; `evaluate` |

### üóÇ Assets
